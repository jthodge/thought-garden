## General Frameworks & Strategies

Best questions = Care about other person when thinking of a Q and ask in that context.

Worst question = ask via curiosity like they are a slot machine

"Tell me your weaknesses" vs "what would make you stronger?"

What are examples of “better questions”?

“How are you? —> “What’s on your mind lately?”
“Are you happy?” —> “Are you proud of yourself?”
“Are you close to your family” —> “How has your family affected you?”

Better questions avoid binary responses (good/bad, yes/no, etc).

- Asking questions that border along the obtuse or nonsensical, just to see how people interpret them.
