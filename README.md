# Thought Garden

This repo is inspired by my friend, [Jasdev](http://twitter.com/jasdev). He maintains [a repo](https://github.com/jasdev/thoughts) that he uses as a space to explore, cultivate, and nurture personal thoughts and ideas. And I think that practice is curious and loving.

And I've decided to emulate this practice! So, I created this space to plant seeds of thought, to water and care for them, and to see how they grow and evolve over time.
